# 🎉 Events & Activities – Backend API

A production-ready **backend API** for an **Event & Activity Management platform**. This server handles authentication, role-based access, event management, image uploads, and secure payments.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Events & Activities Platform** connects individuals who want to participate in local events, sports, or hobbies but lack companions. Whether it’s a **concert, hiking trip, board game night, or tech meetup**, users can easily find like-minded people to join them.

This platform bridges the gap between **online discovery and offline participation**, ensuring no one misses out on an experience just because they don’t have someone to go with. It focuses on building real-world social connections through shared interests and activities.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a social platform that connects people through events and activities
- Enable seamless event creation and participant matching
- Allow users to create profiles highlighting hobbies and interests
- Ensure secure authentication and data handling
